TODO:
* Port connection portion to other DBMS?  Genericize the module?  Start with 
  PostgreSQL. (provider mechanism, and libDBI)
* does determining table name in massvirtual mode upon every request
  cause performance degradation?  If so fix.
* LogSQLRotateLogs directive with daily/monthly/weekly/etc.
* new format char: IP as bigint? ( not w/ ipV6 )
* socket-based middleman daemon with configurable conns, or connect/disconnect.
	DBI connection pool when I switch to DBI.
* ignore by cookie
* tools to import logs into SQL (waiting on permission from author)
* Directive to yes/no create ancillary tables (or just access table)
* break module into separate code files
    separate DB implimentation into sub-modules via provider mechanism
* convert documentation to docbook
* add document building to Makefile.in
* investigate thread safety issues (libmysqlclient_r)
	Add thread locks if using standard mysqlclient
* rewrite main core logging function to optimize for speed.
* Clean up table creation code.
