The "original" document is the LyX file "documentation.lyx" -- all other
files here are derived from it.  The most visually accurate document
and the one I'd recommend reading is the PostScript (.ps) file, although
a whole host of formats are made available here to suit your preference.

To read the HTML docs, open HTML/documentation.html in your browser.
To read the .dvi file, use Xdvi or kdvi.
To read the .ps file, use gv or kghostview.
To read the .lyx file, use LyX.
To read the .txt file, use less.
