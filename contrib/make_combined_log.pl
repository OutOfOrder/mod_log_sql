# make_combined_log.pl
#
# Usage: make_combined_log <days> <virtual host>
#
# This perl script extracts the httpd access data from a MySQL database
# and formats it properly for parsing by 3rd-party log analysis tools.
#
# The script is intended to be run out by cron.  Its commandline arguments tell
# it how many days' worth of access records to extract, and which virtual_host
# you are interested in (because many people log several virthosts to one MySQL
# db.) This permits you to run it daily, weekly, every 9 days -- whatever you
# decide.
#
# Note: By "days" I mean "chunks of 24 hours prior to the moment this script is
# run." So if you run it at 4:34 p.m. on the 12th, it will go back through 4:34
# p.m. on the 11th.
#
# Known issues:
# * Because GET and POST are not discriminated in the MySQL log, we'll just
#   assume that all requests are GETs.  This should have negligible effect
#   on any analysis software.  This could be remedied IF you stored the full
#   HTTP request in your database instead of just the URI, but that's going to
#   cost you a LOT of space really quickly...
#
# * Because this is somewhat of a quick hack it doesn't do the most robust
#   error checking in the world.  Run it by hand to confirm your usage before
#   putting it in crontab.
