    <title>Introduction</title>
    <section tocstyle="fragment">
      <title>Summary</title>
      <para>
        This Apache module will permit you to log to a SQL database; it
        can log each access request as well as data associated with each
        request: cookies, notes, and inbound/outbound headers. Unlike
        logging to a flat text file -- which is standard in Apache -- a
        SQL-based log exhibits tremendous flexibility and power of data
        extraction. (See FAQ entry
        <xref linkend="FAQ.WhyLogToSQL" />
        for further discussion and examples of the advantages to SQL.)
      </para>
      <para>
        This module can either replace or happily coexist with
        mod_log_config, Apache's text file logging facility. In addition
        to being more configurable than the standard module, mod_log_sql
        is much more flexible.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section tocstyle="fragment">
      <title>Approach</title>
      <para>
        This project was formerly known as "mod_log_mysql." It was
        renamed "mod_log_sql" in order to reflect the project goal of
        database in-specificity. The module currently supports MySQL,
        but support for other database back-ends is underway.
      </para>
      <para>
        In order to save speed and overhead, links are kept alive in
        between queries. This module uses one dedicated SQL link per
        httpd child, opened by each child process when it is born. Among
        other things, this means that this module supports logging into
        only one MySQL server, and for now, also, only one SQL database.
        But that's a small tradeoff compared to the blinding speed of
        this module. Error reporting is robust throughout the module and
        will inform the administrator of database issues in the Apache
        ErrorLog for the server/virtual server.
      </para>
      <para>
        Virtual hosts are supported in the same manner they are in the
        regular logging modules. The administrator defines some basic
        'global' directives in the main server config, then defines more
        specific 'local' directives inside each VirtualHost stanza.
      </para>
      <para>
        A robust "preserve" capability has now been implemented. This
        permits the module to preserve any failed INSERT commands to a
        local file on its machine. In any situation that the database is
        unavailable -- e.g. the network fails or the database host is
        rebooted -- mod_log_sql will note this in the error log and
        begin appending its log entries to the preserve file (which is
        created with the user and group ID of the running Apache
        process, e.g. "nobody/nobody" on many Linux installations). When
        database availability returns, mod_log_sql seamlessly resumes
        logging to it. When convenient for the sysadmin, he/she can
        easily import the preserve file into the database because it is
        simply a series of SQL insert statements.
      </para>
    </section>

      <title>What gets logged by default?</title>
      <para>
        All the data that would be contained in the "Combined Log
        Format" is logged by default, plus a little extra. Your best bet
        is to begin by accepting this default, then later customize the
        log configuration based on your needs. The documentation of the
        run-time directives includes a full explanation of what you can
        log, including examples -- see section
        <xref endterm="Sect.ConfigReference.title"
          linkend="Sect.ConfigReference" />
        .
      </para>
    </section>
    <section tocstyle="fragment">
      <title>Miscellaneous Notes</title>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Note which directives go in the 'main server config' and
            which directives apply to the 'virtual host config'. This is
            made clear in the directive documentation.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The 'time_stamp' field is stored in an UNSIGNED INTEGER
            format, in the standard unix "seconds since the epoch"
            format. This is superior to storing the access time as a
            string due to size requirements: an UNSIGNED INT requires 4
            bytes, whereas an Apache date string (e.g.
            "18/Nov/2001:13:59:52 -0800") requires 26 bytes: those extra
            22 bytes become significant when multiplied by thousands of
            accesses on a busy server. Besides, an INT type is far more
            flexible for comparisons, etc.
          </para>
          <para>
            In MySQL 3.21 and above you can easily convert this to a
            human readable format using from_unixtime(), e.g.:
          </para>
          <programlisting>SELECT remote_host,request_uri,from_unixtime(time_stamp)
FROM access_log;</programlisting>
          <para>
            The enclosed perl program "make_combined_log.pl" extracts
            your access log in a format that is completely compatible
            with the Combined Log Format. You can then feed this to your
            favorite web log analysis tool.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The table's string values can be CHAR or VARCHAR, at a
            length of your choice. VARCHAR is superior because it
            truncates long strings; CHAR types are fixed-length and will
            be padded with spaces, resulting in waste. Just like the
            time_stamp issue described above, that kind of space waste
            multiplies over thousands of records.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Be careful not to go overboard setting fields to NOT NULL.
            If a field is marked NOT NULL then it must contain data in
            the INSERT statement, or the INSERT will fail. These
            mysterious failures can be quite frustrating and difficult
            to debug.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            When Apache logs a numeric field, it uses a '-' character to
            mean "not applicable," e.g. the number of bytes returned on
            a 304 (unchanged) request. Since '-' is an illegal character
            in an SQL numeric field, such fields are assigned the value
            0 instead of '-' which, of course, makes perfect sense
            anyway.

        The actual logging code was taken from the already existing flat
        file text modules, so all that credit goes to the Apache
        Software Foundation.

        All changes from 1.06+ and the new documentation were added by
        Chris Powell
        <email>chris &lt;at&gt; grubbybaby &lt;dot&gt; com</email>
        . It seems that the module had fallen into the "un-maintained"
        category -- it had not been updated since 1998 -- so Chris
        adopted it as the new maintainer.
      </para>
      <para>
        In December of 2003, Edward Rudd
        &EmailContact;
        porting the module to Apache 2.0, cleaning up the code,
        converting the documentation to DocBook, optimizing the main
        logging loop, and added the much anticipated database
        abstraction layer.
      </para>
      <para>
        As of February 2004, Chris Powell handed over maintenance of the
        module over to Edward Rudd. So you should contact Edward Rudd
        about the module from now on.

            mod_log_sql can make its own tables on-the-fly, or you can
            pre-make the tables by hand. The advantage of letting the
            module make the tables is ease-of-use, but for raw
            performance you will want to pre-make the tables in order to
            save some overhead. In this basic setup we'll just let the

        <para>
          The most basic directive for the module is
          LogSQLTransferLogFormat, which tells the module which
          information to send to the database; logging to the database
          will not take place without it. Place a
          LogSQLTransferLogFormat directive in the VirtualHost stanza of
          each virtual host that you want to activate.
        </para>
        <para>
          After LogSQLTransferLogFormat you supply a string of
          characters that tell the module what information to log. In
          the configuration directive reference (section
          <xref linkend="Conf.LogSQLTransferLogFormat" />
          ) there is a table which clearly defines all the possible
          things to log. Let's say you want to log only the "request
          time," the "remote host," and the "request"; you'd use:
        </para>
        <programlisting>LogSQLTransferLogFormat hUS</programlisting>

          If you don't choose to log everything that is available,

          Instructing the module what NOT to log using filtering
          directives
        </title>
        <para>
          One "accept" and two "ignore" directives allow you to
          fine-tune what the module should not log. These are very handy
          for keeping your database as uncluttered as possible and
          keeping your statistics free of unneeded numbers. Think of
          each one as a gatekeeper.
        </para>
        <para>
          <emphasis>
            It is important to remember that each of these three
            directives is purely optional. mod_log_sql's default is to
            log everything.
          </emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>
          When a request comes in, the contents of LogSQLRequestAccept
          are evaluated first. This optional, "blanket" directive lets
          you specify that only certain things are to be accepted for
          logging, and everything else discarded. Because it is
          evaluated before LogSQLRequestIgnore and LogSQLRemhostIgnore
          it can halt logging before those two filtering directives "get
          their chance."
        </para>
        <para>
          Once a request makes it past LogSQLRequestAccept, it still can
          be excluded based on LogSQLRemhostIgnore and
          LogSQLRequestIgnore. A good way to use LogSQLRemhostIgnore is
          to prevent the module from logging the traffic that your
          internal hosts generate. LogSQLRequestIgnore is great for
          preventing things like requests for "favicon.ico" from
          cluttering up your database, as well as excluding the various
          requests that worms make, etc.
        </para>
        <para>
          You can specify a series of strings after each directive. Do
          not use any type of globbing or regular-expression syntax --
          each string is considered a match
          <emphasis>
            if it is a substring of the larger request or remote-host;
            the comarison is case-sensitive
          </emphasis>
          . This means that "LogSQLRemhostIgnore micro" will ignore
          requests from "microsoft.com," "microworld.net,"
          "mymicroscope.org," etc. "LogSQLRequestIgnore gif" will
          instruct the module to ignore requests for "leftbar.gif,"
          "bluedot.gif" and even "giftwrap.jpg" -- but "RED.GIF" and
          "Tree.Gif" would still get logged because of case sensitivity.

LogSQLRequestIgnore statistics.html bluedot.jpg</programlisting>
        <para>
          So the first line instructs the module to only log files with
          html, gif and jpg suffixes; requests for "formail.cgi" and
          "shopping-cart.pl" will never be considered for logging.
          ("LeftArrow.JPG" will also never be considered for logging --
          remember, the comparison is case sensitive.) The second line
          prunes the list further -- you never want to log requests for
          those two objects.

          Many users are happy to use the module in its most minimal
          form: they hand-create any necessary tables (using
          "create_tables.sql"), and they configure each VirtualHost by
          hand to suit their needs. However, some administrators need
          extra features due to a large and growing number of
          VirtualHosts. The LogSQLMassVirtualHosting directive activates
          module capabilities that make it far easier to manage an ISP
          environment, or any situation characterized by a large and
          varying number of virtual servers.

              the transfer log table name is dynamically set from the
              virtual host's name (example: a virtual host

          There are numerous benefits. The admin will not need to create
          new tables for every new VirtualHost. (Although the admin will
          still need to drop the tables of virtual hosts that are
          removed.) The admin will not need to set
          LogSQLTransferLogTable for each virtual host -- it will be
          configured automatically based on the host's name. Because
          each virtual host will log to its own segregated table, data
          about one virtual server will segregate from others; an admin
          can grant users access to the tables they need, and they will
          be unable to view data about another user's virtual host.
        </para>
        <para>
          In an ISP scenario the admin is likely to have a cluster of
          many front-end webservers logging to a back-end database.
          mod_log_sql has a feature that permits analysis of how well
          the web servers are loadbalancing: the LogSQLMachineID
          directive. The administrator uses this directive to assign a
          unique identifier to each machine in the web cluster, e.g.
          "LogSQLMachineID web01," "LogSQLMachineID web02," etc. Used in
          conjunction with the 'M' character in LogSQLTransferLogFormat,
          each entry in the SQL log will include the machine ID of the
          machine that created the entry. This permits the administrator
          to count the entries made by each particular machine and
          thereby analyze the front-end loadbalancing algorithm.

        <para>
          A given HTTP request can have a one-to-many relationship with
          certain kinds of data. For example, a single HTTP request can
          have 4 cookies, 3 headers and 5 "mod_gzip" notes associated
          with it. mod_log_sql is capable of logging these relationships
          due to the elegance of SQL relational data.
        </para>
        <para>
          You already have a single table containing access requests.
          One of the columns in that table is 'id' which is intended to
          contain the unique request ID supplied by the standard Apache
          module mod_unique_id -- all you need to do is compile in that
          module and employ the LogSQLTransferLogFormat character 'I'.
          Thereafter, each request gets a unique ID that can be thought
          of as a primary key within the database, useful for joining
          multiple tables. So let's envision several new tables: a notes
          table, a cookies table, and a table for inbound and outbound
          headers.

              DSO). mod_log_sql employs the unique request ID that
              mod_unique_id provides in order to key between the
              separate tables. You can still log the data without
              mod_unqiue_id, but it will be completely uncorrelated and
              you will have no way to discern any meaning.

              Create a SQL index on the "id" column. Without this index,
              table joins will be deathly slow. I recommend you consult

        <title>Using the same database for production and test</title>
        <para>
          Although sub-optimal, it is not uncommon to use the same
          back-end database for the "production" webservers as well as
          the "test" webservers (budgetary constraints, rack-space
          limits, etc.). Furthermore, an administrator in this situation
          may be unable to use LogSQLRemhostIgnore to exclude requests
          from the test servers -- perhaps the generated entries are
          genuinely useful for analytical or QA purposes, but their
          value after analysis is minimal.
        </para>
        <para>
          It is wasteful and potentially confusing to permit this
          internal test data to clutter the database, and a solution to
          the problem is the proper use of the LogSQLMachineID
          directive. Assume a scenario where the production webservers
          have IDs like "web01," "web02," and so on -- and the test
          webservers have IDs like "test01," "test02," etc. Because
          entries in the log database are distinguished by their source
          machine, an administrator may purge unneeded test data from
          the access log as follows:

          Optimizing for a busy database
        </title>
        <para>
          A busy MySQL database will have SELECT statements running
          concurrently with INSERT and UPDATE statements. A long-running
          SELECT can in certain circumstances block INSERTs and
          therefore block mod_log_sql. A workaround is to enable
          mod_log_sql for "delayed inserts," which are described as
          follows in the MySQL documentation.
        </para>
        <para>
          The DELAYED option for the INSERT statement is a
          MySQL-specific option that is very useful if you have clients
          that can't wait for the INSERT to complete. This is a common
          problem when you use MySQL for logging and you also
          periodically run SELECT and UPDATE statements that take a long
          time to complete. DELAYED was introduced in MySQL Version
          3.22.15. It is a MySQL extension to ANSI SQL92.
        </para>
        <para>
          INSERT DELAYED only works with ISAM and MyISAM tables. Note
          that as MyISAM tables supports concurrent SELECT and INSERT,
          if there is no free blocks in the middle of the data file, you
          very seldom need to use INSERT DELAYED with MyISAM.
        </para>
        <para>
          When you use INSERT DELAYED, the client will get an OK at once
          and the row will be inserted when the table is not in use by
          any other thread.
        </para>
        <para>
          Another major benefit of using INSERT DELAYED is that inserts
          from many clients are bundled together and written in one
          block. This is much faster than doing many separate inserts.

            The MySQL documentation concludes, "This means that you
            should only use INSERT DELAYED when you are really sure you
            need it!" Furthermore, the current state of error return
            from a failed INSERT DELAYED seems to be in flux, and may
            behave in unpredictable ways between different MySQL
            versions. See FAQ entry

                mod_log_sql has the ability to create its tables
                on-the-fly. The advantage to this is convenience: you
                don't have to execute any SQL by hand to prepare the
                table. This is especially helpful for people with lots

                user INSERT privileges on the database; in that
                situation you are unable to take advantage of
                LogSQLCreateTables. But most people -- even the very
                security-conscious -- will find that granting CREATE on
                the logging database is reasonable.

                specifically want mod_log_sql to make no attempts to log
                to it. This directive instructs the module to send all
                its log entries directly to the preserve file and to
                make no database INSERT attempts.

                This is presumably a directive for temporary use only;
                it could be dangerous if you set it and forget it, as
                all your entries will simply pile up in the preserve
                file.

                machine's entries if you assign each machine its own
                LogSQLMachineID: for example, the first webserver gets
                ``LogSQLMachineID web01,'' the second gets

                mod_log_sql writes queries to this local preserve file
                in the event that it cannot reach the database, and thus
                ensures that your high-availability web frontend does
                not lose logs during a temporary database outage. This
                could happen for a number of reasons: the database goes
                offline, the network breaks, etc. You will not lose
                entries since the module has this backup. The file
                consists of a series of SQL statements that can be
                imported into your database at your convenience;
                furthermore, because the SQL queries contain the access
                timestamps you do not need to worry about out-of-order
                data after the import, which is done in a simple manner:
              </para>
              <programlisting format="linespecific"># mysql -uadminuser -p mydbname &lt; /tmp/sql-preserve</programlisting>
              <para>
                If you do not define LogSQLPreserveFile then all virtual
                servers will log to the same default preserve file (
                <filename>/tmp/sql-preserve</filename>
                ). You can redefine this on a virtual-host basis in
                order to segregate your preserve files if you desire.
                Note that segregation is not usually necessary, as the
                SQL statements that are written to the preserve file
                already distinguish between different virtual hosts if
                you include the 'v' character in your
                LogSQLTransferLogFormat directive. It is only necessary
                to segregate preserve-files by virualhost if you also
                segregate access logs by virtualhost.
              </para>
              <para>
                The module will log to Apache's ErrorLog when it notices
                a database outage, and upon database return. You will
                therefore know when the preserve file is being used,
                although it is your responsibility to import the file.
              </para>
              <para>
                The file does not need to be created in advance. It is
                safe to remove or rename the file without interrupting
                Apache, as the module closes the filehandle immediately
                after completing the write. The file is created with the
                user &amp; group ID of the running Apache process (e.g.
                'nobody' on many Linux distributions).

                    the transfer log table name is dynamically set from
                    the virtual host's name after stripping out
                    SQL-unfriendly characters (example: a virtual host
                    www.grubbybaby.com gets logged to table
                    access_www_grubbybaby_com)

                    which, in turn, means that each virtual host logs to
                    its own segregated table. Because there is no data
                    shared between virtual servers you can grant your
                    users access to the tables they need; they will be
                    unable to view others' data.

                This is a huge boost in convenience for sites with many
                virtual servers. Activating LogSQLMassVirtualHosting
                obviates the need to create every virtual server's table
                and provides more granular security possibilities.

                Each character in the format-string defines an attribute
                of the request that you wish to log. The default logs
                the information required to create Combined Log Format
                logs, plus several extras. Here is the full list of
                allowable keys, which sometimes resemble their Apache
                counterparts, but do not always:

              <para>
                In HTTP, cookies have names to distinguish them from
                each other. Using mod_usertrack, for example, you can
                give your user-tracking cookies a name with the
                CookieName directive.
              </para>

                mod_log_sql allows you to log cookie information.
                LogSQL_WhichCookie tells mod_log_sql which cookie to
                log. This is necessary because you will usually be
                setting and receiving more than one cookie from a
                client.

                At Apache runtime you can specify the MySQL socket file
                to use. Set this once in your main server config to
                override the default value. This value is irrelevant if
                your database resides on a separate machine.

                mod_log_sql will automatically employ the socket for db
                communications if the database resides on the local
                host. If the db resides on a separate host the module
                will automatically use TCP/IP. This is a function of the
                MySQL API and is not user-configurable.

            <para>
              To begin with, let's get it out of the way: logging to a
              database is not a panacea. But while there are
              complexities with this solution, the benefit can be
              substantial for certain classes of administrator or people
              with advanced requirements:

                  Chores like log rotation go away, as you can DELETE
                  records from the SQL database once they are no longer
                  useful. For example, the excellent and popular
                  log-analysis tool Webalizer (http://www.webalizer.com)
                  does not need historic logs after it has processed
                  them, enabling you to delete older logs.

                  People with clusters of web servers (for high
                  availability) will benefit the most - all their
                  webservers can log to a single SQL database. This
                  obviates the need to collate/interleave the many
                  separate logfiles, which can be / highly/ problematic.

              MySQL is a robust, free, and very powerful
              production-quality database engine. It is well supported
              and comes with detailed documentation. Many 3rd-party
              software pacakges (e.g. Slashcode, the engine that powers
              Slashdot) run exclusively with MySQL. In other words, you

              There are circumstances when that would be quite unwise --
              for example, if Apache could not reach the MySQL server
              for some reason and needed to log that fact. Without a
              text-based error log you'd never know anything was wrong,
              because Apache would be trying to log a database
              connection error to the database... you get the point.

              It depends! This is not determined by mod_log_sql.
              mod_log_sql relies on a connection command that is
              supplied in the MySQL API, and that command is somewhat
              intelligent. How it works:

              the default of "/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock" for
              socket-based connections, whereas the LogSQLTCPPort
              command allows to you override the default TCP port of
              3306 for TCP/IP connections.

            <para>
              This occurs if you compiled PHP with MySQL database
              support. PHP utilizes its internal, bundled MySQL
              libraries by default. These conflict with the "real" MySQL
              libraries linked by mod_log_sql, causing the segmentation
              fault.
            </para>
            <para>
              PHP and mod_log_sql can be configured to happily coexist.
              The solution is to configure PHP to link against the real
              MySQL libraries: recompile PHP using
              --with-mysql=/your/path. Apache will run properly once the
              modules are all using the same version of the MySQL
              libraries.

              First examine the MySQL log that you established in step

              because of a malformed table name or other typographical
              error. By enabling that log, you instructed MySQL to log
              every connection and command it receives -- if you see no
              INSERT attempts in the log, the module isn't successfully
              connecting to the database. If you see nothing at all in
              the log -- not even a record of your administrative
              connection attempts, then you did not enable the log
              correctly. If you do see INSERT attempts but they are

              Please remember that mod_log_sql's overriding principle is
              performance -- that is what the target audience demands
              and expects. Other database logging solutions do not open
              and maintain many database connections, but their
              performance suffers drastically. For example, pgLOGd
              funnels all log connections through a separate daemon that
              connects to the database, but that bottlenecks the entire
              process. mod_log_sql achieves performance numbers an order
              of magnitude greater than the alternatives because it
              dispenses with the overhead associated with rapid
              connection cycling, and it does not attempt to shoehorn
              all the database traffic through a single extra daemon or
              proxy process.

              Why do I occasionally see a "lost connection to MySQL
              server" message in my Apache error log?

              This message may appear every now and then in your Apache
              error log, especially on very lightly loaded servers. This
              does not mean that anything is necessarily wrong. Within
              each httpd child process, mod_log_sql will open (and keep
              open) a connection to the MySQL server. MySQL, however,
              will close connections that have not been used in a while;
              the default timeout is 8 hours. When this occurs,
              mod_log_sql will notice and re-open the connection. That
              event is what is being logged, and looks like this:

              Sometimes a single VirtualHost gets logged to two
              different tables (e.g. access_foo_com,
              access_www_foo_com). Or, accesses to an unqualified
              hostname (e.g. "http://intranet/index.html") get logged in
              separate tables.

              Proper usage of the Apache runtime ServerName directive
              and the directive UseCanonicalName On (or DNS) are
              necessary to prevent this problem. "On" is the default for
              UseCanonicalName, and specifies that self-referential URLs
              are generated from the ServerName part of your
              VirtualHost:

            <para>
              With UseCanonicalName on (and in all versions prior to
              1.3) Apache will use the ServerName and Port directives to
              construct the canonical name for the server. With
              UseCanonicalName off Apache will form self-referential
              URLs using the hostname and port supplied by the client if
              any are supplied (otherwise it will use the canonical
              name, as defined above). [From

              name being accessed. As long as those two directives are
              properly configured, mod_log_sql will log to only one
              table per virtual host while using

              Long answer: you might be evaluating at the output of "ps
              -aufxw" and becoming alarmed at all the 7MB httpd
              processes or 22MB mysqld children that you see. Don't be
              alarmed. It's true that mod_log_sql opens and holds open
              many MySQL connections: each httpd child maintains one
              open database connection (and holds it open for
              performance reasons). Four webservers, each running 20
              Apache children, will hold open 80 MySQL connections,
              which means that your MySQL server needs to handle 80
              simultaneous connections. In truth, your MySQL server
              needs to handle far more than that if traffic to your
              website spikes and the Apache webservers spawn off an
              additional 30 children each...
            </para>
            <para>
              Fortunately the cost reported by 'ps -aufxw' is deceptive.
              This is due to an OS memory-management feature called
              "copy-on-write." When you have a number of identical child
              processes (e.g. Apache, MySQL), it would appear in "ps" as
              though each one occupies a great deal of RAM -- as much as
              7MB per httpd child! In actuality each additional child
              only occupies a small bit of extra memory -- most of the
              memory pages are common to each child and therefore shared
              in a "read-only" fashion. The OS can get away with this
              because the majority of memory pages for one child are
              identical across all children. Instead of thinking of each
              child as a rubber stamp of the others, think of each child
              as a basket of links to a common memory area.
            </para>
            <para>
              A memory page is only duplicated when it needs to be
              written to, hence "copy-on-write." The result is
              efficiency and decreased memory consumption. "ps" may
              report 7MB per child, but it might really only "cost" 900K
              of extra memory to add one more child. It is not correct
              to assume that 20 Apache children with a VSZ of 7MB each
              equals (2 x 7MB) of memory consumption -- the real answer
              is much, much lower. The same "copy-on-write" rules apply
              to all your MySQL children: 40 mysqld children @ 22MB each
              do not occupy 880MB of RAM.
            </para>
            <para>
              The bottom line: although there is a cost to spawn extra
              httpd or mysqld children, that cost is not as great as
              "ps" would lead you to believe.

              INSERT DELAYED is a specific syntax to MySQL and is not

              and what MySQL deficiency is it working around? INSERT
              DELAYED is a kluge.

            <para>
              The MySQL documentation is unclear whether INSERT DELAYED
              is even necessary for an optimized database. It says, "The
              DELAYED option for the INSERT statement is a
              MySQL-specific option that is very useful if you have
              clients that can't wait for the INSERT to complete." But
              then it goes on to say, "Note that as MyISAM tables
              supports concurrent SELECT and INSERT, if there is no free
              blocks in the middle of the data file, you very seldom
              need to use INSERT DELAYED with MyISAM."

          <answer>
            <para>
              Because INSERT DELAYED returns without waiting for the
              data to be written, a hard kill of your MySQL database at
              the right (wrong?) moment could lose those logfile
              entries.

              As of MySQL version 3.23.52, the error return functions

              error. I have reported this bug to the MySQL folks.
              However, we have no way of knowing what solution they will
              adopt to fix this, and with the worst case solution
              mod_log_sql would not be able to tell if anything went

              script enclosed with the distribution. That script
              (make_combined_log.pl) is designed to extract N-many days
              worth of access logs and provide them in a Combined Log

              /etc/crontab to extract logs on a regular basis so that
              your favorite web analysis tool can read them. Or you can

              in /etc/crontab:
            </para>
            <programlisting># Generate the temporary apache logs from the MySQL database (for webalizer)

            <para>
              Or if you have a newer system that puts files in
              /etc/cron.daily etc., create a file called "webalizer" in
              the cron.daily subdirectory. Use the following as the
              contents of your file, and make sure to chmod 755 it when
              done.

          <question>
            <para>How can I log mod_usertrack cookies?</para>
          </question>
          <answer>
            <para>
              A number of people like to log mod_usertrack cookies in
              their Apache TransferLog to aid in understanding their
              visitors' clickstreams. This is accomplished, for example,
              with a statement as follows:
            </para>
            <programlisting>LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" \"%{cookie}n\""</programlisting>
            <para>
              Naturally it would be nice for mod_log_sql to permit the
              admin to log the cookie data as well, so as of version
              1.10 you can do this. You need to have already compiled
              mod_usertrack into httpd -- it's one of the standard
              Apache modules.
            </para>
            <para>
              First make sure you have a column called "cookie" in the
              MySQL database to hold the cookies, which can be done as
              follows if you already have a working database:
            </para>
            <programlisting>mysql&gt; alter table acc_log_tbl add column cookie varchar(255);</programlisting>
            <para>
              Next configure your server to set usertracking cookies as
              follows, and make sure you include the new 'c' directive
              in your LogSQLTransferLogFormat, which activates cookie
              logging. Here's an example:
            </para>
            <programlisting>&lt;VirtualHost 1.2.3.4&gt;
 CookieTracking on
 CookieStyle Cookie
 CookieName Foobar
 LogSQLTransferLogFormat huSUsbTvRAc
 LogSQLWhichCookie Foobar
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</programlisting>
            <para>
              The first three lines configure mod_usertrack to create a
              COOKIE (RFC 2109) format cookie called Foobar. The last
              two lines tell mod_log_sql to log cookies named Foobar.
              You have to choose which cookie to log because more than
              one cookie can/will be sent to the server by the client.
            </para>
            <para>
              Recap: the 'c' character activates cookie logging, and the
              LogSQLWhichCookie directive chooses which cookie to log.
            </para>
            <para>
              FYI, you are advised NOT to use CookieStyle Cookie2 -- it
              seems that even newer browsers (IE 5.5, etc.) have trouble
              with the new COOKIE2 (RFC 2965) format. Just stick with
              the standard COOKIE format and you'll be fine.
            </para>
            <para>
              Perform some hits on your server and run a select

          <question>
            <para>
              What if I want to log more than one cookie? What is the
              difference between LogSQLWhichCookie and
              LogSQLWhichCookies?
            </para>
          </question>
          <answer>
            <para>
              As of version 1.17, you have a choice in how you want
              cookie logging handled.
            </para>
            <para>
              If you are interested in logging only one cookie per
              request, follow the instructions in FAQ entry
              <xref linkend="FAQ.Cookie" />
              above. That cookie will be logged to a column in the
              regular access_log table, and the actual cookie you want
              to log is specified with LogSQLWhichCookie. Don't forget
              to specify the 'c' character in LogSQLTransferLogFormat.
            </para>
            <para>
              If, however, you need to log multiple cookies per request,
              you must employ the LogSQLWhichCookies (note the plural)
              directive. The cookies you specify will be logged to a
              separate table (as discussed in section
              <xref endterm="Sect.MultiTable.title"
                linkend="Sect.MultiTable" />
              ), and entries in that table will be linked to the regular
              access_log entries via the unique ID that is supplied by
              mod_unique_id. Without mod_unique_id the information will
              still be logged but you will be unable to correlate which
              cookies go with which access-requests. Furthermore, with
              LogSQLWhichCookies, you do not need to include the 'c'
              character in LogSQLTransferLogFormat.
            </para>
            <para>
              LogSQLWhichCookie and LogSQLWhichCookies can coexist
              without conflict because they operate on entireley
              different tables, but you're better off choosing the one
              you need.

          <question>
            <para>
              What are the SSL logging features, and how do I activate
              them?
            </para>
          </question>
          <answer>
            <note>
              <para>
                You do not need to compile SSL support into mod_log_sql
                in order to simply use it with a secure site. You only
                need to compile SSL support into mod_log_sql if you want
                to log SSL-specific data such as the cipher type used,
                or the keysize that was negotiated. If that information
                is unimportant to you, you can ignore this FAQ.
              </para>
            </note>
            <para>
              By adding certain characters to your
              LogSQLTransferLogFormat string you can tell mod_log_sql to
              log the SSL cipher, the SSL keysize of the connection, and
              the maximum keysize that was available. This would let you
              tell, for example, which clients were using only
              export-grade security to access your secure software area.
            </para>
            <para>
              You can compile mod_log_sql with SSL logging support if
              you have the right packages installed. If you already have
              an SSL-enabled Apache then you by definition have the
              correct packages already installed: OpenSSL and mod_ssl.
            </para>
            <para>
              You need to ensure that your database is set up to log the
              SSL data. Issue the following commands to MySQL if your
              access table does not already have them:
            </para>
            <programlisting>mysql&gt; alter table access_log add column ssl_cipher varchar(25);
mysql&gt; alter table access_log add column ssl_keysize smallint unsigned;
mysql&gt; alter table access_log add column ssl_maxkeysize smallint unsigned;</programlisting>
            <para>
              Finally configure httpd.conf to activate the SSL fields.
              Note that this is only meaningful in a VirtualHost that is
              set up for SSL.
            </para>
            <programlisting>&lt;VirtualHost 1.2.3.4:443&gt;
 LogSQLTransferLogFormat AbHhmRSsTUuvcQqz
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</programlisting>
            <para>
              You also need to make sure you have the mod_log_sql_ssl
              module loaded as well.
            </para>
            <para>
              The last three characters (Qqz) in the directive are the
              SSL ones; see section
              <xref linkend="Conf.LogSQLTransferLogFormat" />
              in the directives documentation for details of the
              LogSQLTransferLogFormat directive.
            </para>
            <para>
              Restart Apache, then perform some hits on your server.
              Then run the following select statement:
