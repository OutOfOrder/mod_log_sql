TODO:
* Port connection portion to other DBMS?  Genericize the module?  Start with 
  PostgreSQL. (provider mechanism, and libDBI)
* does determining table name in massvirtual mode upon every request
  cause performance degradation?  If so fix. No other feasable way to fix this, 
  unless you cache, but then for large amounts of hosts, this can be a waste.
* LogSQLRotateLogs directive with daily/monthly/weekly/etc.
* socket-based middleman daemon with configurable conns, or connect/disconnect.
* DBI connection pool when I switch to DBI.
* ignore by cookie
* break module into separate code files
    SSL already separated.
    separate DB implimentation into sub-modules via provider mechanism
* investigate thread safety issues 
	Use libmysqlclient_r for threaded MPM (or always?)
	Add thread locks if using standard mysqlclient 
	Check locking issues with the preserve file?
* rewrite main core logging function to optimize for speed.
* Clean up table creation code.
	support DB independent way of defining the tables
