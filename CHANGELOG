TODO:
* Full commenting of the code.


CHANGES:

1.09:

* If the MySQL INSERT causes an error, we re-try that INSERT after
  a short 1/2-second sleep just to make sure it wasn't due to a 
  network glitch or other gremlin.
* Made the default log format: huSUsbTvRA.  This provides everything
  required to reproduce Combined Log Format data.


1.08: 

* Now log a single '-' (instead of a zero-length string) when
  User-Agent is blank. This is similar to what Apache does in its own
  logs.  (Should have caught this when I did the same thing for
  Referer.)
* Separated documentation into README, INSTALL, CHANGELOG, etc. as
  appropriate.


1.07:

* Renamed TransferIgnore directive to RequestIgnore, since that's
  really a more specific and accurate description of what that
  directive means. 
* Now log a single '-' (instead of a zero-length string) when Referer
  is blank. This is similar to what Apache does in its own logs.


1.06:

* Added 'R' and 'A' options to TransferLogMySQLFormat so that we now
  can log Referer and Agent respectively. 
* Code cleanup: all compilation warnings are now gone, even with -Wall. 
  (They were mainly "const" issues that needed straightening up.)
* Added RemhostIgnore configuration directive to permit non-logging of
  any request coming from a specific host, e.g. a local network
  machine, etc. 
* Now use the non-obsolete ap_compat.h headerfile instead of
  compat.h.  This simply gets rid of a compilation warning, nothing
  more.
* Now include a headerfile (http_log.h) that was missing.  Its
  absence was giving us this warning message: "implicit declaration of
  function `ap_log_error_old'." 
* For numerics that Apache customarily logs as a "-" we now log a zero
  instead of a -1.  This seems to be more intuitive, e.g. in the
  "bytes_sent" column.
* We now have a Makefile and a full "make" process that does all
  the real work.
* New maintainer.
 

1.05:

* Removed some redundant code, after being noted by Vivek Khera that
  this code doesn't even get called with the current apache code.  It
  can be done in apache 1.3, but it works ok without it anyway.
* Added the necessary include file to make the module compile under
  Apache 1.3b6.  I haven't actually tested that it works, though.
  indent'd the code.


1.04:

* Rearranged some code to allow for a successful apache 1.3beta
  compilation.  Please note that this is *untested*, I only got it to
  compile, I haven't actually tried to run apache 1.3.


1.03:

* Changed the check for 'mysql server has gone away' to be case
  insensitive, so that it works with MySQL 3.21 
* Changed the behavior so that a link isn't established until it's
  necessary (e.g., if SQL logging is used for one virtual IP, a link
  won't be opened until there's an access to that IP).


1.02:

* Managed to track down that segmentation fault that occured once, and
  fixed it.  No known bugs now exist.


1.01:

* Segmentation fault in case of certain parameters lacking fixed.
* Worked around the SIGPIPE signal that's sent in certain events from
* mysql_query(). Minor modifications
