    <title>Introduction</title>
    <section>
      <title>Summary</title>
      <para>This Apache module will permit you to log to a SQL database; it can log each access request as well as data associated with each request: cookies, notes, and inbound/outbound headers. Unlike logging to a flat text file -- which is standard in Apache -- a SQL-based log exhibits tremendous flexibility and power of data extraction. (See FAQ entry <xref linkend="FAQ.WhyLogToSQL"/> for further discussion and examples of the advantages to SQL.)</para>
      <para>This module can either replace or happily coexist with mod_log_config, Apache's text file logging facility. In addition to being more configurable than the standard module, mod_log_sql is much more flexible.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Approach</title>
      <para>This project was formerly known as "mod_log_mysql." It was renamed "mod_log_sql" in order to reflect the project goal of database in-specificity. The module currently supports MySQL, but support for other database back-ends is underway.</para>
      <para>In order to save speed and overhead, links are kept alive in between queries. This module uses one dedicated SQL link per httpd child, opened by each child process when it is born. Among other things, this means that this module supports logging into only one MySQL server, and for now, also, only one SQL database. But that's a small tradeoff compared to the blinding speed of this module. Error reporting is robust throughout the module and will inform the administrator of database issues in the Apache ErrorLog for the server/virtual server.</para>
      <para>Virtual hosts are supported in the same manner they are in the regular logging modules. The administrator defines some basic 'global' directives in the main server config, then defines more specific 'local' directives inside each VirtualHost stanza.</para>
      <para>A robust "preserve" capability has now been implemented. This permits the module to preserve any failed INSERT commands to a local file on its machine. In any situation that the database is unavailable -- e.g. the network fails or the database host is rebooted -- mod_log_sql will note this in the error log and begin appending its log entries to the preserve file (which is created with the user and group ID of the running Apache process, e.g. "nobody/nobody" on many Linux installations). When database availability returns, mod_log_sql seamlessly resumes logging to it. When convenient for the sysadmin, he/she can easily import the preserve file into the database because it is simply a series of SQL insert statements.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>What gets logged by default?</title>
      <para>All the data that would be contained in the "Combined Log Format" is logged by default, plus a little extra. Your best bet is to begin by accepting this default, then later customize the log configuration based on your needs. The documentation of the run-time directives includes a full explanation of what you can log, including examples -- see section <xref endterm="Sect.ConfigReference.title" linkend="Sect.ConfigReference"/>.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Miscellaneous Notes</title>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Note which directives go in the 'main server config' and which directives apply to the 'virtual host config'. This is made clear in the directive documentation.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The 'time_stamp' field is stored in an UNSIGNED INTEGER format, in the standard unix "seconds since the epoch" format. This is superior to storing the access time as a string due to size requirements: an UNSIGNED INT requires 4 bytes, whereas an Apache date string (e.g. "18/Nov/2001:13:59:52 -0800") requires 26 bytes: those extra 22 bytes become significant when multiplied by thousands of accesses on a busy server. Besides, an INT type is far more flexible for comparisons, etc.</para>
          <para>In MySQL 3.21 and above you can easily convert this to a human readable format using from_unixtime(), e.g.: </para>
          <programlisting>select remote_host,request_uri,from_unixtime(time_stamp) from access_log; </programlisting>
          <para>The enclosed perl program "make_combined_log.pl" extracts your access log in a format that is completely compatible with the Combined Log Format. You can then feed this to your favorite web log analysis tool.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The table's string values can be CHAR or VARCHAR, at a length of your choice. VARCHAR is superior because it truncates long strings; CHAR types are fixed-length and will be padded with spaces, resulting in waste. Just like the time_stamp issue described above, that kind of space waste multiplies over thousands of records.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Be careful not to go overboard setting fields to NOT NULL. If a field is marked NOT NULL then it must contain data in the INSERT statement, or the INSERT will fail. These mysterious failures can be quite frustrating and difficult to debug.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>When Apache logs a numeric field, it uses a '-' character to mean "not applicable," e.g. the number of bytes returned on a 304 (unchanged) request. Since '-' is an illegal character in an SQL numeric field, such fields are assigned the value 0 instead of '-' which, of course, makes perfect sense anyway.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Author / Maintainer</title>
      <para>The actual logging code was taken from the already existing flat file text modules, so all that credit goes to the Apache Software Foundation.</para>
      <para>The MySQL routines and directives were added by Zeev Suraski &lt;bourbon@netvision.net.il&gt;. </para>
      <para>All changes from 1.06+ and the new documentation were added by Chris Powell <email>chris &lt;at&gt; grubbybaby &lt;dot&gt; com</email>. It seems that the module had fallen into the "un-maintained" category -- it had not been updated since 1998 -- so Chris adopted it as the new maintainer.</para>
      <para>In December of 2003, Edward Rudd &EmailContact; porting the module to Apache 2.0, cleaning up the code, converting the documentation to DocBook, optimizing the main logging loop, and added the much anticipated database abstraction layer.</para>
      <para>As of February 2004, Chris Powell handed over maintenance of the module over to Edward Rudd. So you should contact Edward Rudd about the module from now on.</para>

      <title>How to tune logging with run-time directives</title>
      <section>
        <title>Instructing the module what to log</title>
        <para>The most basic directive for the module is LogSQLTransferLogFormat, which tells the module which information to send to the database; logging to the database will not take place without it. Place a LogSQLTransferLogFormat directive in the VirtualHost stanza of each virtual host that you want to activate.</para>
        <para>After LogSQLTransferLogFormat you supply a string of characters that tell the module what information to log. In the configuration directive reference (section <xref linkend="Conf.LogSQLTransferLogFormat"/>) there is a table which clearly defines all the possible things to log. Let's say you want to log only the "request time," the "remote host," and the "request"; you'd use:</para>
        <programlisting>LogSQLTransferLogFormat hUS</programlisting>
        <para>But a more appropriate string to use is</para>
        <programlisting>LogSQLTransferLogFormat AbHhmRSsTUuv</programlisting>
        <para>which logs all the information required to be compatible with the Combined Log Format (CLF).</para>
        <para>If you don't choose to log everything that is available, that's fine. Fields in the unused columns in your table will simply contain NULL.</para>
        <para>Some of the LogSQLTransferLogFormat characters require a little extra configuration:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>If you specify 'c' to indicate that you want to log the cookie value, you must also tell the module which cookie you mean by using LogSQLWhichCookie -- after all, there could be many cookies associated with a given request. Fail to specify LogSQLWhichCookie, and no cookie information at all will be logged. </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>If you specify 'M' to indicate that you want to log the machine ID, you must also tell the module this machine's identity using the LogSQLMachineID directive. Fail to specify LogSQLMachineID, and a simple '-' character will be logged in the machine_id column.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </section>
      <section id="Sect.Ignore">
        <title id="Sect.Ignore.title">Instructing the module what NOT to log using filtering directives</title>
        <para>One "accept" and two "ignore" directives allow you to fine-tune what the module should not log. These are very handy for keeping your database as uncluttered as possible and keeping your statistics free of unneeded numbers. Think of each one as a gatekeeper.</para>
        <para><emphasis>It is important to remember that each of these three directives is purely optional. mod_log_sql's default is to log everything.</emphasis></para>
        <para>When a request comes in, the contents of LogSQLRequestAccept are evaluated first. This optional, "blanket" directive lets you specify that only certain things are to be accepted for logging, and everything else discarded. Because it is evaluated before LogSQLRequestIgnore and LogSQLRemhostIgnore it can halt logging before those two filtering directives "get their chance." </para>
        <para>Once a request makes it past LogSQLRequestAccept, it still can be excluded based on LogSQLRemhostIgnore and LogSQLRequestIgnore. A good way to use LogSQLRemhostIgnore is to prevent the module from logging the traffic that your internal hosts generate. LogSQLRequestIgnore is great for preventing things like requests for "favicon.ico" from cluttering up your database, as well as excluding the various requests that worms make, etc.</para>
        <para>You can specify a series of strings after each directive. Do not use any type of globbing or regular-expression syntax -- each string is considered a match <emphasis>if it is a substring of the larger request or remote-host; the comarison is case-sensitive</emphasis>. This means that "LogSQLRemhostIgnore micro" will ignore requests from "microsoft.com," "microworld.net," "mymicroscope.org," etc. "LogSQLRequestIgnore gif" will instruct the module to ignore requests for "leftbar.gif," "bluedot.gif" and even "giftwrap.jpg" -- but "RED.GIF" and "Tree.Gif" would still get logged because of case sensitivity.</para>
        <para>A summary of the decision flow:</para>
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>If LogSQLRequestAccept exists and a request does not match anything in that list, it is discarded.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>If a request matches anything in the LogSQLRequestIgnore list, it is discarded.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>If a reqiest matches anything in the LogSQLRemhostIgnore list, it is discarded.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Otherwise the request is logged.</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>This means that you can have a series of directives similar to the following:</para>
        <programlisting>LogSQLRequestAccept .html .gif .jpg
LogSQLRequestIgnore statistics.html bluedot.jpg</programlisting>
        <para>So the first line instructs the module to only log files with html, gif and jpg suffixes; requests for "formail.cgi" and "shopping-cart.pl" will never be considered for logging. ("LeftArrow.JPG" will also never be considered for logging -- remember, the comparison is case sensitive.) The second line prunes the list further -- you never want to log requests for those two objects.</para>

        <title>Using the module in an ISP environment</title>
        <para>mod_log_sql has three basic tiers of operation:</para>
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The administrator creates all necessary tables by hand and configures each Apache VirtualHost by hand. (LogSQLCreateTables Off)</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>The module is permitted to create necessary tables on-the-fly, but the administrator configures each Apache VirtualHost by hand. (LogSQLCreateTables On)</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>The module is permitted to create all necessary tables and to make intelligent, on-the-fly configuration of each VirtualHost. (LogSQLMassVirtualHosting On)</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>Many users are happy to use the module in its most minimal form: they hand-create any necessary tables (using "create_tables.sql"), and they configure each VirtualHost by hand to suit their needs. However, some administrators need extra features due to a large and growing number of VirtualHosts. The LogSQLMassVirtualHosting directive activates module capabilities that make it far easier to manage an ISP environment, or any situation characterized by a large and varying number of virtual servers.</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>the on-the-fly table creation feature is activated automatically</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>the transfer log table name is dynamically set from the virtual host's name (example: a virtual host "www.grubbybaby.com" gets logged to table "access_www_grubbybaby_com")</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>There are numerous benefits. The admin will not need to create new tables for every new VirtualHost. (Although the admin will still need to drop the tables of virtual hosts that are removed.) The admin will not need to set LogSQLTransferLogTable for each virtual host -- it will be configured automatically based on the host's name. Because each virtual host will log to its own segregated table, data about one virtual server will segregate from others; an admin can grant users access to the tables they need, and they will be unable to view data about another user's virtual host.</para>
        <para>In an ISP scenario the admin is likely to have a cluster of many front-end webservers logging to a back-end database. mod_log_sql has a feature that permits analysis of how well the web servers are loadbalancing: the LogSQLMachineID directive. The administrator uses this directive to assign a unique identifier to each machine in the web cluster, e.g. "LogSQLMachineID web01," "LogSQLMachineID web02," etc. Used in conjunction with the 'M' character in LogSQLTransferLogFormat, each entry in the SQL log will include the machine ID of the machine that created the entry. This permits the administrator to count the entries made by each particular machine and thereby analyze the front-end loadbalancing algorithm.</para>
      </section>
      <section id="Sect.MultiTable">
        <title id="Sect.MultiTable.title">Logging many-to-one data in separate tables</title>
        <para>A given HTTP request can have a one-to-many relationship with certain kinds of data. For example, a single HTTP request can have 4 cookies, 3 headers and 5 "mod_gzip" notes associated with it. mod_log_sql is capable of logging these relationships due to the elegance of SQL relational data.</para>
        <para>You already have a single table containing access requests. One of the columns in that table is 'id' which is intended to contain the unique request ID supplied by the standard Apache module mod_unique_id -- all you need to do is compile in that module and employ the LogSQLTransferLogFormat character 'I'. Thereafter, each request gets a unique ID that can be thought of as a primary key within the database, useful for joining multiple tables. So let's envision several new tables: a notes table, a cookies table, and a table for inbound and outbound headers.</para>

        <title>Using the same database for production and test</title>
        <para>Although sub-optimal, it is not uncommon to use the same back-end database for the "production" webservers as well as the "test" webservers (budgetary constraints, rack-space limits, etc.). Furthermore, an administrator in this situation may be unable to use LogSQLRemhostIgnore to exclude requests from the test servers -- perhaps the generated entries are genuinely useful for analytical or QA purposes, but their value after analysis is minimal.</para>
        <para>It is wasteful and potentially confusing to permit this internal test data to clutter the database, and a solution to the problem is the proper use of the LogSQLMachineID directive. Assume a scenario where the production webservers have IDs like "web01," "web02," and so on -- and the test webservers have IDs like "test01," "test02," etc. Because entries in the log database are distinguished by their source machine, an administrator may purge unneeded test data from the access log as follows:</para>
        <programlisting>delete from access_log where machine_id like 'test%';</programlisting>

        <title id="Sect.DelayedInsert.title">Optimizing for a busy database</title>
        <para>A busy MySQL database will have SELECT statements running concurrently with INSERT and UPDATE statements. A long-running SELECT can in certain circumstances block INSERTs and therefore block mod_log_sql. A workaround is to enable mod_log_sql for "delayed inserts," which are described as follows in the MySQL documentation.</para>
        <para>The DELAYED option for the INSERT statement is a MySQL-specific option that is very useful if you have clients that can't wait for the INSERT to complete. This is a common problem when you use MySQL for logging and you also periodically run SELECT and UPDATE statements that take a long time to complete. DELAYED was introduced in MySQL Version 3.22.15. It is a MySQL extension to ANSI SQL92.</para>
        <para>INSERT DELAYED only works with ISAM and MyISAM tables. Note that as MyISAM tables supports concurrent SELECT and INSERT, if there is no free blocks in the middle of the data file, you very seldom need to use INSERT DELAYED with MyISAM. </para>
        <para>When you use INSERT DELAYED, the client will get an OK at once and the row will be inserted when the table is not in use by any other thread.</para>
        <para>Another major benefit of using INSERT DELAYED is that inserts from many clients are bundled together and written in one block. This is much faster than doing many separate inserts. </para>

              <para>There is a slight disadvantage: if you wish to activate this feature, then the userid specified in LogSQLLoginInfo must have CREATE privileges on the database.

              <para>mod_log_sql writes queries to this local preserve file in the event that it cannot reach the database, and thus ensures that your high-availability web frontend does not lose logs during a temporary database outage. This could happen for a number of reasons: the database goes offline, the network breaks, etc. You will not lose entries since the module has this backup. The file consists of a series of SQL statements that can be imported into your database at your convenience; furthermore, because the SQL queries contain the access timestamps you do not need to worry about out-of-order data after the import, which is done in a simple manner:</para>

              <para>If you do not define LogSQLPreserveFile then all virtual servers will log to the same default preserve file (<filename>/tmp/sql-preserve</filename>). You can redefine this on a virtual-host basis in order to segregate your preserve files if you desire. Note that segregation is not usually necessary, as the SQL statements that are written to the preserve file already distinguish between different virtual hosts if you include the 'v' character in your LogSQLTransferLogFormat directive. It is only necessary to segregate preserve-files by virualhost if you also segregate access logs by virtualhost.</para>
              <para>The module will log to Apache's ErrorLog when it notices a database outage, and upon database return. You will therefore know when the preserve file is being used, although it is your responsibility to import the file.</para>
              <para>The file does not need to be created in advance. It is safe to remove or rename the file without interrupting Apache, as the module closes the filehandle immediately after completing the write. The file is created with the user &amp; group ID of the running Apache process (e.g. 'nobody' on many Linux distributions).</para>

              <para>Defines which table is used for logging of notes. Working in conjunction with LogSQLWhichNotes, you can log many of each request's associated notes to a separate table. For meaningful data retrieval the notes table is keyed to the access table by the unique request ID supplied by the standard Apache module mod_unique_id.</para>

                <para>This table must be created (see create-tables.sql included in the package), or LogSQLCreateTables must be set to 'On'.</para>

              <para>If you administer a site hosting many, many virtual hosts then this option will appeal to you. If you turn on LogSQLMassVirtualHosting then several things happen:</para>
              <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                  <para>the on-the-fly table creation feature is activated automatically</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                  <para>the transfer log table name is dynamically set from the virtual host's name after stripping out SQL-unfriendly characters (example: a virtual host www.grubbybaby.com gets logged to table access_www_grubbybaby_com)</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                  <para>which, in turn, means that each virtual host logs to its own segregated table. Because there is no data shared between virtual servers you can grant your users access to the tables they need; they will be unable to view others' data.</para>
                </listitem>
              </itemizedlist>
              <para>This is a huge boost in convenience for sites with many virtual servers. Activating LogSQLMassVirtualHosting obviates the need to create every virtual server's table and provides more granular security possibilities.</para>

          </question>
          <answer>
            <para>To begin with, let's get it out of the way: logging to a database is not a panacea. But while there are complexities with this solution, the benefit can be substantial for certain classes of administrator or people with advanced requirements:</para>
            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>Chores like log rotation go away, as you can DELETE records from the SQL database once they are no longer useful. For example, the excellent and popular log-analysis tool Webalizer (http://www.webalizer.com) does not need historic logs after it has processed them, enabling you to delete older logs.</para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>People with clusters of web servers (for high availability) will benefit the most - all their webservers can log to a single SQL database. This obviates the need to collate/interleave the many separate logfiles, which can be / highly/ problematic.</para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>People acquainted with the power of SQL SELECT statements will know the flexibility of the extraction possibilities at their fingertips.</para>

            <para>Why use MySQL? Are there alternatives?</para>
          </question>
          <answer>
            <para>MySQL is a robust, free, and very powerful production-quality database engine. It is well supported and comes with detailed documentation. Many 3rd-party software pacakges (e.g. Slashcode, the engine that powers Slashdot) run exclusively with MySQL. In other words, you will belong to a very robust and well-supported community by choosing MySQL.</para>
            <para>That being said, there are alternatives. PostgreSQL is probably MySQL's leading "competitor" in the free database world. There is also an excellent module available for Apache to permit logging to a PostgreSQL database, called <ulink url="http://www.digitalstratum.com/pglogd/">pgLOGd</ulink></para>

          <answer>
            <para>It depends! This is not determined by mod_log_sql. mod_log_sql relies on a connection command that is supplied in the MySQL API, and that command is somewhat intelligent. How it works:</para>
            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <simpara>if the specified MySQL database is on the same machine, the connection command uses a socket to communicate with MySQL</simpara>

              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            <para>You don't have any control of which methodology is used. You can fine-tune some of the configuration, however. The LogSQLSocketFile runtime configuration directive overrides the default of "/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock" for socket-based connections, whereas the LogSQLTCPPort command allows to you override the default TCP port of 3306 for TCP/IP connections.</para>

          <answer>
            <para>This occurs if you compiled PHP with MySQL database support. PHP utilizes its internal, bundled MySQL libraries by default. These conflict with the "real" MySQL libraries linked by mod_log_sql, causing the segmentation fault.</para>
            <para>PHP and mod_log_sql can be configured to happily coexist. The solution is to configure PHP to link against the real MySQL libraries: recompile PHP using --with-mysql=/your/path. Apache will run properly once the modules are all using the same version of the MySQL libraries.</para>

            <note><para>It is improper to ask for help before you have followed these steps.</para></note>
            <para>First examine the MySQL log that you established in step <xref linkend="Item.EnableLogging"/> of section <xref endterm="Sect.Preperation.title" linkend="Sect.Preperation"/>. Ensure that the INSERT statements are not being rejected because of a malformed table name or other typographical error. By enabling that log, you instructed MySQL to log every connection and command it receives -- if you see no INSERT attempts in the log, the module isn't successfully connecting to the database. If you see nothing at all in the log -- not even a record of your administrative connection attempts, then you did not enable the log correctly. If you do see INSERT attempts but they are failing, the log should tell you why.</para>
            <para>Second, confirm that your LogSQL* directives are all correct.</para>
            <para>Third, examine the Apache error logs for messages from mod_log_sql; the module will offer hints as to why it cannot connect, etc. </para>

            <para>Please remember that mod_log_sql's overriding principle is performance -- that is what the target audience demands and expects. Other database logging solutions do not open and maintain many database connections, but their performance suffers drastically. For example, pgLOGd funnels all log connections through a separate daemon that connects to the database, but that bottlenecks the entire process. mod_log_sql achieves performance numbers an order of magnitude greater than the alternatives because it dispenses with the overhead associated with rapid connection cycling, and it does not attempt to shoehorn all the database traffic through a single extra daemon or proxy process.</para>

            <para>Why do I occasionally see a "lost connection to MySQL server" message in my Apache error log?</para>
          </question>
          <answer>
            <para>This message may appear every now and then in your Apache error log, especially on very lightly loaded servers. This does not mean that anything is necessarily wrong. Within each httpd child process, mod_log_sql will open (and keep open) a connection to the MySQL server. MySQL, however, will close connections that have not been used in a while; the default timeout is 8 hours. When this occurs, mod_log_sql will notice and re-open the connection. That event is what is being logged, and looks like this:</para>
            <programlisting>[Tue Nov 12 19:04:10 2002] [error] mod_log_sql: first attempt failed,

          <answer>
            <para>Proper usage of the Apache runtime ServerName directive and the directive UseCanonicalName On (or DNS) are necessary to prevent this problem. "On" is the default for UseCanonicalName, and specifies that self-referential URLs are generated from the ServerName part of your VirtualHost:</para>
            <para>With UseCanonicalName on (and in all versions prior to 1.3) Apache will use the ServerName and Port directives to construct the canonical name for the server. With UseCanonicalName off Apache will form self-referential URLs using the hostname and port supplied by the client if any are supplied (otherwise it will use the canonical name, as defined above). [From <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#usecanonicalname">the Apache documentation</ulink>]</para>
            <para>The module inherits Apache's "knowledge" about the server name being accessed. As long as those two directives are properly configured, mod_log_sql will log to only one table per virtual host while using LogSQLMassVirtualHosting.</para>

          <question>
            <para>Do I need to be worried about all the running MySQL children? Will holding open n Apache-to-MySQL connections consume a lot of memory? </para>
          </question>
          <answer>
            <para>Short answer: you shouldn't be worried.</para>
          </answer>
          <answer>
            <para>Long answer: you might be evaluating at the output of "ps -aufxw" and becoming alarmed at all the 7MB httpd processes or 22MB mysqld children that you see. Don't be alarmed. It's true that mod_log_sql opens and holds open many MySQL connections: each httpd child maintains one open database connection (and holds it open for performance reasons). Four webservers, each running 20 Apache children, will hold open 80 MySQL connections, which means that your MySQL server needs to handle 80 simultaneous connections. In truth, your MySQL server needs to handle far more than that if traffic to your website spikes and the Apache webservers spawn off an additional 30 children each...</para>
            <para>Fortunately the cost reported by 'ps -aufxw' is deceptive. This is due to an OS memory-management feature called "copy-on-write." When you have a number of identical child processes (e.g. Apache, MySQL), it would appear in "ps" as though each one occupies a great deal of RAM -- as much as 7MB per httpd child! In actuality each additional child only occupies a small bit of extra memory -- most of the memory pages are common to each child and therefore shared in a "read-only" fashion. The OS can get away with this because the majority of memory pages for one child are identical across all children. Instead of thinking of each child as a rubber stamp of the others, think of each child as a basket of links to a common memory area.</para>
            <para>A memory page is only duplicated when it needs to be written to, hence "copy-on-write." The result is efficiency and decreased memory consumption. "ps" may report 7MB per child, but it might really only "cost" 900K of extra memory to add one more child. It is not correct to assume that 20 Apache children with a VSZ of 7MB each equals (2 x 7MB) of memory consumption -- the real answer is much, much lower. The same "copy-on-write" rules apply to all your MySQL children: 40 mysqld children @ 22MB each do not occupy 880MB of RAM.</para>
            <para>The bottom line: although there is a cost to spawn extra httpd or mysqld children, that cost is not as great as "ps" would lead you to believe.</para>

            <para>What is the issue with activating delayed inserts?</para>
          </question>
          <answer>
            <para>INSERT DELAYED is a specific syntax to MySQL and is not supported by any other database. Ergo, why is it needed, and what MySQL deficiency is it working around? INSERT DELAYED is a kluge.</para>
          </answer>
          <answer>
            <para>The MySQL documentation is unclear whether INSERT DELAYED is even necessary for an optimized database. It says, "The DELAYED option for the INSERT statement is a MySQL-specific option that is very useful if you have clients that can't wait for the INSERT to complete." But then it goes on to say, "Note that as MyISAM tables supports concurrent SELECT and INSERT, if there is no free blocks in the middle of the data file, you very seldom need to use INSERT DELAYED with MyISAM."</para>
          </answer>
          <answer>
            <para>Because INSERT DELAYED returns without waiting for the data to be written, a hard kill of your MySQL database at the right (wrong?) moment could lose those logfile entries.</para>
          </answer>
          <answer>
            <para>As of MySQL version 3.23.52, the error return functions disagree after a failed INSERT DELAYED: mysql_errno() always returns 0, even if mysql_error() returns a textual error. I have reported this bug to the MySQL folks. However, we have no way of knowing what solution they will adopt to fix this, and with the worst case solution mod_log_sql would not be able to tell if anything went wrong with a delayed insert.</para>
          </answer>
          <answer>
            <para>Instead of delayed inserts, you may wish to utilize InnoDB tables (instead of the standard MyISAM tables). InnoDB tables suppot row-level locking and are recommended for high-volume databases.</para>

            <para>How do I extract the data in a format that my analysis tool can understand?</para>
          </question>
          <answer>
            <para>mod_log_sql would be virtually useless if there weren't a way for you to extract the data from your database in a somewhat meaningful fashion. To that end there's a Perl script enclosed with the distribution. That script (make_combined_log.pl) is designed to extract N-many days worth of access logs and provide them in a Combined Log Format output. You can use this very tool right in /etc/crontab to extract logs on a regular basis so that your favorite web analysis tool can read them. Or you can examine the Perl code to construct your own custom tool.</para>
            <para>For example, let's say that you want your web statistics updated once per day in the wee hours of the morning. A good way to accomplish that could be the following entries in /etc/crontab:</para>
            <programlisting># Generate the temporary apache logs from the MySQL database (for webalizer) 
05 04 * * * root make_combined_log.pl 1 www.grubbybaby.com &gt; /var/log/temp01
# Run webalizer on httpd log 
30 04 * * * root webalizer -c /etc/webalizer.conf; rm -f /var/log/temp01</programlisting>
            <para>Or if you have a newer system that puts files in /etc/cron.daily etc., create a file called "webalizer" in the cron.daily subdirectory. Use the following as the contents of your file, and make sure to chmod 755 it when done.</para>
            <programlisting>#!/bin/sh
/usr/local/sbin/make_combined_log.pl 1 www.yourdomain.com &gt; /var/log/httpd/templog

        <qandaentry id="FAQ.Cookie">
          <question>
            <para>How can I log mod_usertrack cookies?</para>
          </question>
          <answer>
            <para>A number of people like to log mod_usertrack cookies in their Apache TransferLog to aid in understanding their visitors' clickstreams. This is accomplished, for example, with a statement as follows:</para>
            <programlisting>LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" \"%{cookie}n\""</programlisting>
            <para>Naturally it would be nice for mod_log_sql to permit the admin to log the cookie data as well, so as of version 1.10 you can do this. You need to have already compiled mod_usertrack into httpd -- it's one of the standard Apache modules.</para>
            <para>First make sure you have a column called "cookie" in the MySQL database to hold the cookies, which can be done as follows if you already have a working database:</para>
            <programlisting>mysql&gt; alter table acc_log_tbl add column cookie varchar(255);</programlisting>
            <para>Next configure your server to set usertracking cookies as follows, and make sure you include the new 'c' directive in your LogSQLTransferLogFormat, which activates cookie logging. Here's an example:</para>
            <programlisting>&lt;VirtualHost 1.2.3.4&gt;
 CookieTracking on
 CookieStyle Cookie
 CookieName Foobar
 LogSQLTransferLogFormat huSUsbTvRAc
 LogSQLWhichCookie Foobar
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</programlisting>
            <para>The first three lines configure mod_usertrack to create a COOKIE (RFC 2109) format cookie called Foobar. The last two lines tell mod_log_sql to log cookies named Foobar. You have to choose which cookie to log because more than one cookie can/will be sent to the server by the client.</para>
            <para>Recap: the 'c' character activates cookie logging, and the LogSQLWhichCookie directive chooses which cookie to log.</para>
            <para>FYI, you are advised NOT to use CookieStyle Cookie2 -- it seems that even newer browsers (IE 5.5, etc.) have trouble with the new COOKIE2 (RFC 2965) format. Just stick with the standard COOKIE format and you'll be fine.</para>
            <para>Perform some hits on your server and run a select</para>

          </question>
          <answer>
            <para>As of version 1.17, you have a choice in how you want cookie logging handled.</para>
            <para>If you are interested in logging only one cookie per request, follow the instructions in FAQ entry <xref linkend="FAQ.Cookie"/> above. That cookie will be logged to a column in the regular access_log table, and the actual cookie you want to log is specified with LogSQLWhichCookie. Don't forget to specify the 'c' character in LogSQLTransferLogFormat.</para>
            <para>If, however, you need to log multiple cookies per request, you must employ the LogSQLWhichCookies (note the plural) directive. The cookies you specify will be logged to a separate table (as discussed in section <xref endterm="Sect.MultiTable.title" linkend="Sect.MultiTable"/>), and entries in that table will be linked to the regular access_log entries via the unique ID that is supplied by mod_unique_id. Without mod_unique_id the information will still be logged but you will be unable to correlate which cookies go with which access-requests. Furthermore, with LogSQLWhichCookies, you do not need to include the 'c' character in LogSQLTransferLogFormat.</para>
            <para>LogSQLWhichCookie and LogSQLWhichCookies can coexist without conflict because they operate on entireley different tables, but you're better off choosing the one you need.</para>

            <para>What are the SSL logging features, and how do I activate them?</para>
          </question>
          <answer>
            <note>
              <para>You do not need to compile SSL support into mod_log_sql in order to simply use it with a secure site. You only need to compile SSL support into mod_log_sql if you want to log SSL-specific data such as the cipher type used, or the keysize that was negotiated. If that information is unimportant to you, you can ignore this FAQ.</para>
            </note>
            <para>By adding certain characters to your LogSQLTransferLogFormat string you can tell mod_log_sql to log the SSL cipher, the SSL keysize of the connection, and the maximum keysize that was available. This would let you tell, for example, which clients were using only export-grade security to access your secure software area.</para>
            <para>You can compile mod_log_sql with SSL logging support if you have the right packages installed. If you already have an SSL-enabled Apache then you by definition have the correct packages already installed: OpenSSL and mod_ssl.</para>
            <para>You need to ensure that your database is set up to log the SSL data. Issue the following commands to MySQL if your access table does not already have them:</para>
            <programlisting>mysql&gt; alter table access_log add column ssl_cipher varchar(25);
mysql&gt; alter table access_log add column ssl_keysize smallint unsigned;
mysql&gt; alter table access_log add column ssl_maxkeysize smallint unsigned;</programlisting>
            <para>Finally configure httpd.conf to activate the SSL fields. Note that this is only meaningful in a VirtualHost that is set up for SSL.</para>
            <programlisting>&lt;VirtualHost 1.2.3.4:443&gt;
 LogSQLTransferLogFormat AbHhmRSsTUuvcQqz 
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</programlisting>
            <para>You also need to make sure you have the mod_log_sql_ssl module loaded as well.</para>
            <para>The last three characters (Qqz) in the directive are the SSL ones; see section <xref linkend="Conf.LogSQLTransferLogFormat"/> in the directives documentation for details of the LogSQLTransferLogFormat directive.</para>
            <para>Restart Apache, then perform some hits on your server. Then run the following select statement:</para>
            <programlisting>mysql&gt; select remote_host,request_uri,ssl_cipher,ssl_keysize,ssl_maxkeysize from access_log where ssl_cipher is not null;</programlisting>
