4.1.1 Why log to an SQL database?
</H3>

<P>
To begin with, let's get it out of the way: logging to a database
is not a panacea. But while there are complexities with this solution,
the benefit can be substantial for certain classes of administrator
or people with advanced requirements:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Chores like log rotation go away, as you can DELETE records from the
SQL database once they are no longer useful. For example, the excellent
and popular log-analysis tool Webalizer (http://www.webalizer.com)
does not need historic logs after it has processed them, enabling
you to delete older logs.
</LI>
<LI>People with clusters of web servers (for high availability) will benefit
the most - all their webservers can log to a single SQL database.
This obviates the need to collate/interleave the many separate logfiles,
which can be / highly/ problematic. 
</LI>
<LI>People acquainted with the power of SQL SELECT statements will know
the flexibility of the extraction possibilities at their fingertips.
</LI>
</UL>
For example, do you want to see all your 404's? Do this:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>select&nbsp;remote_host,status,request_uri,bytes_sent,from_unixtime(time_stamp)

4.1.2 Why use MySQL? Are there alternatives?</A>
</H3>

<P>
MySQL is a robust, free, and very powerful production-quality database
engine. It is well supported and comes with detailed documentation.
Many 3rd-party software pacakges (e.g. Slashcode, the engine that
powers Slashdot) run exclusively with MySQL. In other words, you will
belong to a very robust and well-supported community by choosing MySQL.

<P>
That being said, there are alternatives. PostgreSQL is probably MySQL's
leading &#34;competitor&#34; in the free database world.
There is also an excellent module available for Apache to permit logging
to a PostgreSQL database, called pgLOGd (http://www.digitalstratum.com/pglogd/).

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00051300000000000000">
4.1.3 Is this code production-ready?</A>
</H3>

<P>
By all accounts it is. It is known to work without a problem on many-thousands-of-hits-per-day
webservers. Does that mean it is 100% bug free? Well, no software
is. But it is well-tested and believed to be fully compatible with
production environments. (The usual disclaimers apply. This software
is provided without warranty of any kind.)

4.1.4 Who's using mod_log_sql?</A>
</H3>

<P>
Good question! It would be great to find out! If you are a production-level
mod_log_sql user, please contact the maintainer, Chris Powell (chris@grubbybaby.com)
so that you can be mentioned here.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00051500000000000000">
4.1.5 Why doesn't the module also replace the Apache ErrorLog?</A>
</H3>

<P>
There are circumstances when that would be quite unwise - for example,
if Apache could not reach the MySQL server for some reason and needed
to log that fact. Without a text-based error log you'd never know
anything was wrong, because Apache would be trying to log a database
connection error to the database... you get the point.

<P>
Error logs are usually not very high-traffic and are really best left
as text files on a web server machine.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00051600000000000000">
4.1.6 Does mod_log_sql work with Apache 2.x?</A>
</H3>

<P>
As of this writing, no. The Apache Group significantly altered the
module API with the release of Apache 2.0. All modules written for
1.3, including mod_log_sql, will not work with 2.0.

<P>
mod_log_sql will eventually be ported to Apache 2.x, but not immediately.
It is going to take some time, and there are other features that have
higher priority. Please sign up for the announcements list (on the
main website) or monitor the website for updates to learn when the
port (and other releases) are available.

<P>
&lt;OPINION&gt;If you're a *NIX user, stick with Apache 1.3.x for now.
Major modules like mod_ssl and PHP are not even ready for 2.0 yet,
and the main benefits in 2.0 are for Win32 users anyway. Apache 1.3.x
is rock-stable and performs equally well on *NIX as 2.0.&lt;/OPINION&gt;

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00051700000000000000">
4.1.7 Does mod_log_sql connect to MySQL via TCP/IP or a socket?</A>
</H3>

<P>
It depends! This is not determined by mod_log_sql. mod_log_sql
relies on a connection command that is supplied in the MySQL API,
and that command is somewhat intelligent. How it works:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>if the specified MySQL database is on the same machine, the connection
command uses a socket to communicate with MySQL
</LI>
<LI>if the specified MySQL database is on a different machine, mod_log_sql
connects using TCP/IP. 
</LI>
</UL>
You don't have any control of which methodology is used. You can fine-tune
some of the configuration, however. The L<SMALL>OG</SMALL>SQLS<SMALL>OCKET</SMALL>F<SMALL>ILE</SMALL>
runtime configuration directive overrides the default of ``/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock''
for socket-based connections, whereas the L<SMALL>OG</SMALL>SQLTCPP<SMALL>ORT</SMALL> command
allows to you override the default TCP port of 3306 for TCP/IP connections.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00051800000000000000">
4.1.8 I have discovered a bug. Who can I contact?</A>
</H3>

<P>
Please contact the maintainer (chris@grubbybaby.com)! Your
comments, suggestions, bugfixes, bug catches, and usage testimonials
are always welcome. As free software, mod_log_sql is intended to
be a community effort - any code contributions or other ideas will
be fully and openly credited, of course.

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00052100000000000000">
4.2.1 Apache segfaults when using PHP and mod_log_sql</A>
</H3>

<P>
This occurs if you compiled PHP with MySQL database support. PHP utilizes
its internal, bundled MySQL libraries by default. These conflict with
the ``real'' MySQL libraries linked by mod_log_sql, causing
the segmentation fault. 

<P>
The solution is to configure PHP to link against the real MySQL libraries
and recompile mod_php. Apache will run properly once the modules
are all using the same version of the MySQL libraries.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00052200000000000000"></A><A NAME="faq:NothingLogged"></A>
<BR>
4.2.2 Apache appears to start up fine, but nothing
is getting logged in the database
</H3>

<P>
If you do not see any entries in the access_log, then something is
preventing the inserts from happening. This could be caused by several
things:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Improper privileges set up in the MySQL database 
</LI>
<LI>You aren't hitting a VirtualHost that has a LogSQLTransferLogTable
entry 
</LI>
<LI>You didn't specify the right database host or login information
</LI>
<LI>Another factor is preventing a connection to the database
</LI>
</UL>
Important: it is improper to ask for help before you have followed
these steps.

<P>
First examine the MySQL log that you established in step <A HREF="node4.html#step:EnaLog">6</A>
of section <A HREF="node4.html#sub:PrepDb">3.1</A>. Ensure that the INSERT statements are
not being rejected because of a malformed table name or other typographical
error. By enabling that log, you instructed MySQL to log every connection
and command it receives - if you see no INSERT attempts in the log,
the module isn't successfully connecting to the database. If you see
nothing at all in the log - not even a record of your administrative
connection attempts, then you did not enable the log correctly. If
you do see INSERT attempts but they are failing, the log should tell
you why.

<P>
Second, confirm that your L<SMALL>OG</SMALL>SQL* directives are all correct.

<P>
Third, examine the Apache error logs for messages from mod_log_sql;
the module will offer hints as to why it cannot connect, etc. 

<P>
The next thing to do is recompile the module with debugging output
activated. change the &#34;#undef DEBUG&#34; on line 8
of mod_log_sql.c to &#34;#define DEBUG&#34; and recompile/reinstall.
The module will now output copious notes about what it is doing, and
this will help you (and the maintainer) solve the problem. In order
to see the debugging messages, ensure that you make them visible using
the L<SMALL>OG</SMALL>L<SMALL>EVEL</SMALL> directive <B>in the main server config
as well as in each</B> <B>V<SMALL>IRTUAL</SMALL>H<SMALL>OST</SMALL></B> <B>config:</B>

4.2.4 My database cannot handle all the open connections from mod_log_sql,

</H3>

<P>
The rule of thumb: if you have <I>n</I> webservers each configured
to support <I>y</I> M<SMALL>AX</SMALL>C<SMALL>LIENTS</SMALL>, then your database must be
able to handle <IMG
 WIDTH="41" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$n\times y$"> simultenous connections <I>in the worst
case.</I> Certainly you must use common sense, consider reasonable traffic
expectations and structure things accordingly.

<P>
Tweaking my.cnf to scale to high connection loads is imperative. But
if hardware limitations prevent your MySQL server from gracefully
handling the number of incoming connections, it would be beneficial
to upgrade the memory or CPU on that server in order to handle the
load. 

<P>
Jeremy Zawodny, a highly respected MySQL user and contributor to Linux
Magazine, has this very helpful and highly appropriate article on
tuning MySQL: http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/000173.html

<P>
Please remember that mod_log_sql's overriding principle is <B>performance</B>
- that is what the target audience demands and expects. Other database
logging solutions do not open and maintain many database connections,
but their performance suffers drastically. For example, pgLOGd funnels
all log connections through a separate daemon that connects to the
database, but that bottlenecks the entire process. mod_log_sql achieves
performance numbers an order of magnitude greater than the alternatives
because it dispenses with the overhead associated with rapid connection
cycling, and it doesn't attempt to shoehorn all the database traffic
through a single extra daemon or proxy process.

4.2.5 Why do I occasionally see a ``lost connection to MySQL server''
message in my Apache error log?</A>
</H3>

<P>
This message may appear every now and then in your Apache error log,
especially on very lightly loaded servers. This doesn't mean that
anything is necessarily wrong. Within each httpd child process, mod_log_sql
will open (and keep open) a connection to the MySQL server. MySQL,
however, will close connections that haven't been used in a while;
the default timeout is 8 hours. When this occurs, mod_log_sql will
notice and re-open the connection. That event is what is being logged,
and looks like this:

Ten total ab runs were conducted: five with MySQL logging enabled,

each five were averaged. The results:

<LI>Average of five runs employing <I>only</I> standard text logging:

In other words, any rate-limiting effects on this particular hardware
setup are not caused by MySQL. Note that although this very simple
webserver setup is hardly cutting-edge - it is, after all, a fairly
small machine - 139 requests per second equal over <I>twelve million
hits per day.</I>

<OL>
<LI>Use a target URL that is on your own webserver :-).

several thousand requests your TCP/IP stack will be filled with hundreds
of connections in TIME_WAIT that need to close. Do a &#34;netstat
-t|wc -l&#34; on the webserver to see. If you don't wait, you
can expect to see a lot of messages like &#34;ip_conntrack:
table full, dropping packet&#34; in your logs. (This has nothing
to do with mod_log_sql, this is simply the nature of the TCP/IP
stack in the Linux kernel.)

4.3.2 Do I need to be worried about all the running MySQL children? Will
holding open <I>n</I> Apache-to-MySQL connections consume a lot of
memory? </A>
</H3>

<P>
Short answer: you shouldn't be worried.

<P>
Long answer: you might be evaluating at the output of ``ps -aufxw''
and becoming alarmed at all the 7MB httpd processes or 22MB mysqld
children that you see. Don't be alarmed<I>.</I> It's true that mod_log_sql
opens and holds open many MySQL connections: each httpd child maintains
one open database connection (and holds it open for performance reasons).
Four webservers, each running 20 Apache children, will hold open 80
MySQL connections, which means that your MySQL server needs to handle
80 simultaneous connections. In truth, your MySQL server needs to
handle far more than that if traffic to your website spikes and the
Apache webservers spawn off an additional 30 children each...

<P>
Fortunately the cost reported by 'ps -aufxw' is deceptive. This is
due to an OS memory-management feature called ``copy-on-write.''
When you have a number of identical child processes (e.g. Apache,
MySQL), it would appear in ``ps'' as though each one occupies
a great deal of RAM - as much as 7MB per httpd child! In actuality
each additional child only occupies a small bit of extra memory -
most of the memory pages are common to each child and therefore shared
in a ``read-only'' fashion. The OS can get away with this because
the majority of memory pages for one child are identical across all
children. Instead of thinking of each child as a rubber stamp of the
others, think of each child as a basket of links to a common memory
area.

<P>
A memory page is only duplicated when it needs to be written to, hence
``copy-on-write.'' The result is efficiency and decreased memory
consumption. ``ps'' may report 7MB per child, but it might really
only ``cost'' 900K of extra memory to add one more child. It is
<B>not</B> <B>correct</B> to assume that 20 Apache
children with a VSZ of 7MB each equals <!-- MATH
 $(20\times 7MB)$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="$(20\times 7MB)$"> of memory
consumption - the real answer is much, much lower. The same ``copy-on-write''
rules apply to all your MySQL children: 40 mysqld children @ 22MB
each <B>do not</B> occupy 880MB of RAM.

<P>
The bottom line: although there is a cost to spawn extra httpd or
mysqld children, that cost is not as great as ``ps'' would lead
you to believe.

If you have exhausted all the tuning possibilities on your existing

4.3.4 What is the issue with activating delayed
inserts?
</H3>

<P>
There are several.

<P>

<OL>
<LI>INSERT DELAYED is a specific syntax to MySQL and is not supported
by any other database. Ergo, why is it needed, and what MySQL deficiency
is it working around? INSERT DELAYED is a kluge.
</LI>
<LI>The MySQL documentation is unclear whether INSERT DELAYED is even
necessary for an optimized database. It says, ``The DELAYED option
for the INSERT statement is a MySQL-specific option that is very useful
if you have clients that can't wait for the INSERT to complete.''
But then it goes on to say, ``Note that as MyISAM tables supports
concurrent SELECT and INSERT, if there is no free blocks in the middle
of the data file, you very seldom need to use INSERT DELAYED with
MyISAM.''
</LI>
<LI>Because INSERT DELAYED returns without waiting for the data to be
written, a hard kill of your MySQL database at the right (wrong?)
moment could lose those logfile entries.
</LI>
<LI>As of MySQL version 3.23.52, the error return functions disagree after
a failed INSERT DELAYED: mysql_errno() always returns 0, even if
mysql_error() returns a textual error. I have reported this bug to
the MySQL folks. However, we have no way of knowing what solution
they will adopt to fix this, and with the worst case solution mod_log_sql
would not be able to tell if anything went wrong with a delayed insert.
</LI>
</OL>
Instead of delayed inserts, you may wish to utilize InnoDB tables
(instead of the standard MyISAM tables). InnoDB tables suppot row-level
locking and are recommended for high-volume databases.

<P>
If after understanding these problems you still wish to enable delayed
inserts, section <A HREF="node4.html#sub:DelayedIns">3.5.4</A> discusses how.

Proper usage of the Apache runtime S<SMALL>ERVER</SMALL>N<SMALL>AME</SMALL> directive and
the directive U<SMALL>SE</SMALL>C<SMALL>ANONICAL</SMALL>N<SMALL>AME </SMALL>O<SMALL>N</SMALL> (or DNS) are necessary

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
With UseCanonicalName on (and in all versions prior to 1.3) Apache
will use the ServerName and Port directives to construct the canonical
name for the server. With UseCanonicalName off Apache will form self-referential
URLs using the hostname and port supplied by the client if any are
supplied (otherwise it will use the canonical name, as defined above).
[From the Apache documentation http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#usecanonicalname]

4.4.2 How do I extract the data in a format that my analysis tool can understand?</A>
</H3>

<P>
mod_log_sql would be virtually useless if there weren't a way for
you to extract the data from your database in a somewhat meaningful
fashion. To that end there's a Perl script enclosed with the distribution.
That script (make_combined_log.pl) is designed to extract N-many
days worth of access logs and provide them in a Combined Log Format
output. You can use this very tool right in /etc/crontab to extract
logs on a regular basis so that your favorite web analysis tool can
read them. Or you can examine the Perl code to construct your own
custom tool.

<P>
For example, let's say that you want your web statistics updated once
per day in the wee hours of the morning. A good way to accomplish
that could be the following entries in /etc/crontab:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>

</DL>Or if you have a newer system that puts files in /etc/cron.daily etc.,
create a file called ``webalizer'' in the cron.daily subdirectory.
Use the following as the contents of your file, and make sure to chmod
755 it when done.

4.4.3 How can I log mod_usertrack cookies?
</H3>

<P>
A number of people like to log mod_usertrack cookies in their Apache
TransferLog to aid in understanding their visitors' clickstreams.
This is accomplished, for example, with a statement as follows:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>LogFormat&nbsp;&#34;%h&nbsp;%l&nbsp;%u&nbsp;%t&nbsp;&#92;&#34;%r&#92;&#34;&nbsp;%s&nbsp;%b&nbsp;&#92;&#34;%{Referer}i&#92;&#34;&nbsp;&#92;&#34;%{User-Agent}i&#92;&#34;&#34;&nbsp;&#92;&#34;%{cookie}n&#92;&#34;&#34;
</DD>
</DL>Naturally it would be nice for mod_log_sql to permit the admin to
log the cookie data as well, so as of version 1.10 you can do this.
You need to have already compiled mod_usertrack into httpd - it's
one of the standard Apache modules.

<P>
First make sure you have a column called &#34;cookie&#34;
in the MySQL database to hold the cookies, which can be done as follows
if you already have a working database:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>alter&nbsp;table&nbsp;acc_log_tbl&nbsp;add&nbsp;column&nbsp;cookie&nbsp;varchar(255);
</DD>
</DL>Next configure your server to set usertracking cookies as follows,
and make sure you include the new 'c' directive in your L<SMALL>OG</SMALL>SQLT<SMALL>RANSFER</SMALL>L<SMALL>OG</SMALL>F<SMALL>ORMAT</SMALL>,
which activates cookie logging. Here's an example:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>&lt;VirtualHost&nbsp;1.2.3.4&gt;&nbsp;

<P>
&nbsp;CookieTracking&nbsp;on&nbsp;

<P>
&nbsp;CookieStyle&nbsp;Cookie&nbsp;

<P>
&nbsp;CookieName&nbsp;Foobar&nbsp;

<P>
&nbsp;LogSQLTransferLogFormat&nbsp;huSUsbTvRAc&nbsp;

<P>
&nbsp;LogSQLWhichCookie&nbsp;Foobar&nbsp;

<P>
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</DD>
</DL>The first three lines configure mod_usertrack to create a COOKIE
(RFC 2109) format cookie called Foobar. The last two lines tell mod_log_sql
to log cookies named Foobar. You have to choose which cookie to log
because more than one cookie can/will be sent to the server by the
client.

<P>
Recap: the 'c' character <I>activates</I> cookie logging, and the
L<SMALL>OG</SMALL>SQLW<SMALL>HICH</SMALL>C<SMALL>OOKIE</SMALL> directive <I>chooses</I> which cookie to
log.

<P>
FYI, you are advised NOT to use C<SMALL>OOKIE</SMALL>S<SMALL>TYLE </SMALL>C<SMALL>OOKIE2</SMALL> - it
seems that even newer browsers (IE 5.5, etc.) have trouble with the
new COOKIE2 (RFC 2965) format. Just stick with the standard COOKIE
format and you'll be fine.

<P>
Perform some hits on your server and run a select:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>

4.4.4 What if I want to log more than one cookie? What is the difference
between LogSQLWhichCookie and LogSQLWhichCookies?</A>
</H3>

<P>
As of version 1.17, you have a choice in how you want cookie logging
handled.

<P>
If you are interested in logging only one cookie per request, follow
the instructions in section <A HREF="node5.html#sec:cookie">4.4.3</A> above. That cookie will
be logged to a column in the regular access_log table, and the actual
cookie you want to log is specified with L<SMALL>OG</SMALL>SQLW<SMALL>HICH</SMALL>C<SMALL>OOKIE</SMALL>.
Don't forget to specify the 'c' character in L<SMALL>OG</SMALL>SQLT<SMALL>RANSFER</SMALL>L<SMALL>OG</SMALL>F<SMALL>ORMAT</SMALL>.

<P>
If, however, you need to log multiple cookies per request, you must
employ the L<SMALL>OG</SMALL>SQLW<SMALL>HICH</SMALL>C<SMALL>OOKIES</SMALL> (note the plural) directive.
The cookies you specify will be logged to a separate table (as discussed
in section <A HREF="node4.html#secMulTable">3.5.2</A>), and entries in that table will be
linked to the regular access_log entries via the unique ID that is
supplied by mod_unique_id. Without mod_unique_id the information
will still be logged but you will be unable to correlate which cookies
go with which access-requests. Furthermore, with L<SMALL>OG</SMALL>SQLW<SMALL>HICH</SMALL>C<SMALL>OOKIES</SMALL>,
you do <B>not</B> need to include the 'c' character in L<SMALL>OG</SMALL>SQLT<SMALL>RANSFER</SMALL>L<SMALL>OG</SMALL>F<SMALL>ORMAT</SMALL>.

<P>
L<SMALL>OG</SMALL>SQLW<SMALL>HICH</SMALL>C<SMALL>OOKIE</SMALL> and L<SMALL>OG</SMALL>SQLW<SMALL>HICH</SMALL>C<SMALL>OOKIES</SMALL> can coexist
without conflict because they operate on entireley different tables,

<P>
Note: you do <B>not</B> need to compile SSL support into mod_log_sql
in order to simply use it with a secure site. You only need to compile
SSL support into mod_log_sql if you want to log SSL-specific data
such as the cipher type used, or the keysize that was negotiated.
If that information is unimportant to you, you can ignore this FAQ.

<P>
By adding certain characters to your L<SMALL>OG</SMALL>SQLT<SMALL>RANSFER</SMALL>L<SMALL>OG</SMALL>F<SMALL>ORMAT</SMALL>

would let you tell, for example, which clients were using only export-grade
security to access your secure software area.

<P>
You can compile mod_log_sql with SSL logging support if you have
the right packages installed. If you already have an SSL-enabled Apache
then you by definition have the correct packages already installed:
OpenSSL and mod_ssl.

<P>
You need to ensure that your database is set up to log the SSL data.
